Add the "parse_meta" action to Posy's @entry_actions array between

USE

This module currently assumes a very particular structure about one's
entry files.  Given an entry of the following structure:

  The Entry's Title
  <!--
  meta-via: blair christensen.
  meta-links: http://devclue.com/ http://search.cpan.org/
  -->
  The rest of the entry is down here.

Everything between "<!--" and "-->" will be removed from the entry's
body after being processed by "parse_meta".  In addition, the following
variables will be set:

  $current_entry->{meta}{via} = "blair christensen.";
  $current_entry->{meta}{links} = "http://devclue.com/ http://search.cpan.org/"
